## 1.   Introduction

In my previous work I implemented basic Login and Signup Web Template in which I using Custom PHP for data parsing but this time, I switched to CodeIgniter which is a PHP Framework for Dynamic and Faster Web Development.
As usual, Front-end is designed in HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap 4. 
Right now It includes functionality of Logging in and Signup with basic data validation.
Design is simplistic and clean and Repsonsive.
